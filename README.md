# bike-theft
This app displays the list of reported bike thefts based on the Bikewise API.

CONTEXT
Stolen bikes are a typical problem in Berlin. The Police want to be more efficient in resolving stolen bike cases. They decided to build a software that can automate their processes — the software that you're going to develop.

This app needs to display the list of reported bike thefts based on the Bikewise API.

PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
As a police officer:

 I want to see a list of reported bike thefts for the Berlin area.

 I want to see the first 10 bike theft cases, with the ability to - paginate (10 cases per page).

 I want to see a total number of bike theft cases.

 For each reported bike theft I want to see:

 Case title

 Case description

 Date of the theft

 Date of when the case was reported

 Location of the theft

 Picture of the bike, if available

 I want to filter reported bike thefts by partial case title.

 I want to filter reported bike thefts by date range.

 I want to see a loading state until the list is available.

 I want to see an error state if the list is unavailable.

 I want to see an empty state if there are no results.

YOUR MISSION
Create the React application that satisfies all must-have requirements above, plus any nice-to-have requirements you wish to include.

For that, you’ll need to make requests to a publicly-available API to get JSON content and print it on view.

The API is known to have some limitations. If you are not able to implement a particular requirement, please provide a description of what and why you could not implements.
